            My blood murmurs
            like a secret spring,
            always of you, always of me.
            
            Beneath the reeling moon
            dance my naked searching dreams,
            sleepwalker children,
            soft over dark hedgerows.
            
            Oh, your lips are sun-kissed…
            The intoxicating scent of your lips…
            And out of bloom clusters silver-ringed
            you smile… you, you.
            
            Always the creeping trickling
            over my skin
            Out over my shoulder –
            I listen in …
            
            My blood murmurs
            like a secret spring.
